1. Make a list of all project numbers for projects that involve an employee whose last name 
is ‘Scott’, either as a worker or as a manager of the department that controls the project.

SELECT P.Pno
FROM Project P, Department D, Employee E
WHERE E.SSN = D.MgrSSN
    AND D.Dno = P.Dno
    AND E.Name = 'veeresh';



2. Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the ‘IoT’ project is given a 10 
percent raise. 


SELECT E.SSN, E.Name, E.Salary, E.Salary * 1.1 AS NewSalary
FROM employee E
JOIN works_on W ON E.SSN = W.ESSN
JOIN project P ON P.Pno = W.Pno
WHERE P.Pname = 'IoT';



3. Find the sum of the salaries of all employees of the ‘Accounts’ department, as well as the 
maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary in this department 

SELECT 
    SUM(salary) AS TotalSalary,
    MAX(salary) AS MaxSalary,
    MIN(salary) AS MinSalary,
    AVG(salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM 
    employee e, 
    department d 
WHERE 
    e.Dno = d.Dno 
    AND Dname = 'CS';
 


4. Retrieve the name of each employee who works on all the projects controlled by 
department number 5 (use NOT EXISTS operator). 

SELECT e.Name
FROM employee e
JOIN works_on w ON e.SSN = w.ESSN
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT p.Pno
    FROM project p
    WHERE p.Dno = 5
    AND p.Pno = w.Pno
);


5. For each department that has more than five employees, retrieve the department number 
and the number of its employees who are making more than Rs.6,00,000. 

SELECT DNO,COUNT(SSN) 
FROM EMPLOYEE 
WHERE SALARY>600000 AND DNO IN (SELECT DNO 
FROM EMPLOYEE 
GROUP BY DNO 
HAVING COUNT(SSN)>5) 
GROUP BY DNO; 

Output: 
DNO COUNT(SSN) 
3 4
